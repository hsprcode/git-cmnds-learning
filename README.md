# git-cmnds-learning (git add, commit, branch and merge)

This is just a text file with git commands used in command line; I used this file to learn git commands present in the file itself.

These commands helps to understand the usage of git in the terminal, and github.

Started with a new folder.
Created a text file using touch command.
Then used all the commands in the text file to understand them.
